{% include JB/setup %}

I'm currently a student at [Caltech](http://caltech.edu/). I love science and math, and I enjoy building computer projects. I believe science and technology can make the world a better place, and I want myself to develop/use science and technology in a public-spirited way. I take interest in natural language processing and machine learning, also interested in computational sciences such as computational biology and bioinformatics. 

I learned programming and made my first web project back in 7th grade, which was a website publicizing the diversity of ethnic minority languages (Mongolian, Tibetan, Uygur, etc.) in China. Since then, I've picked up some Java/Python/C and been involved in a few [projects]({{ site.projects_path }}). Last year I joined Lenovo as an intern and worked for [GreenTea Browser](http://app.lenovo.com/appdetail/com.lenovo.browser/0), the built-in browser for Lenovo Android phones. Apart from programming, sometimes I do a little bit of design as well, including the graphic design of a flora catalogue with 100+ pages and the design of several websites.

I also devote some of my time to education. I volunteer for a few education-related non-profit organizations such as [Shanghai Young Bakers](http://www.shanghaiyoungbakers.com/) and [The Clover Center for Autistic Children](http://www.shsyc.com/). This summer I worked at [SaTToL](http://www.sattol.org/) as a teaching assistance. I am especially interested in citizen science education. I served as one of the leaders of my high school's Science & Tech Association, and organized various events aimed at promoting popular science. This year I interned part-time at [Scientific American Chinese Edition](http://huanqiukexue.com/) as an English->Chinese translator, introducing great science writings to the Chinese audience.

Reading usually engages my spare time. Although I'm far from an expert, I enjoy reading literature and philosophy, and I would like to mention that the [Symposium](http://www.symposiumchina.org/#!syllabus-2014/c18o9) reading group is one of my best reading experience ever. Other hobbies include travelling, jigsaw puzzles, Rubik's cube, piano and guitar.
